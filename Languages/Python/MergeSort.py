#This program gives an example of Merge sort

#   Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm. In the divide and
#   conquer paradigm, a problem is broken into pieces where each piece
#   still retains all the properties of the larger problem -- except
#   its size. To solve the original problem, each piece is solved
#   individually; then the pieces are merged back together.

#  Best = Average = Worst = O(nlog(n))
